# Training enemy agent with GPU commands (2025-05-28 01:43:04)

_**User**_

@workspace what are the terminal commands I need to run to train my enemy agent with my gpu?

---

_**Assistant**_

Based on your workspace, you have several options for training your enemy agent with GPU acceleration. Here are the main approaches:

## Option 1: Pure NumPy GPU Training (Recommended)

This uses your custom CUDA kernels without PyTorch:

```bash
python -m ai_platform_trainer.ai.models.train_enemy_rl_gpu
```

## Option 2: GPU Environment with Stable-Baselines3

Train using your CUDA physics engine with PPO:

```bash
python ai_platform_trainer/cpp/train_gpu_fixed.py --num-envs 4 --timesteps 100000
```

## Option 3: Build and Test Pipeline

Run the complete GPU pipeline build and test:

```bash
python build_and_test_gpu_pipeline.py
```

## Option 4: Multi-method Training Script

This auto-detects the best available method (CUDA, PyTorch, or CPU):

```bash
python train_enemy_agent.py --episodes 500 --output models/enemy_rl/gpu_model
```

## Verification First

Before training, verify your GPU setup works:

```bash
# Test GPU environment
python test_gpu_success.py

# Verify CUDA kernels
python ai_platform_trainer/cpp/verify_gpu_training.py --cuda-test

# Quick pipeline test
python test_gpu_rl_pipeline.py
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Verify GPU setup**:
   ```bash
   python test_gpu_success.py
   ```

2. **Train with pure NumPy (no PyTorch dependency)**:
   ```bash
   python -m ai_platform_trainer.ai.models.train_enemy_rl_gpu
   ```

This will use your custom CUDA kernels from `physics.cu` for GPU-accelerated physics simulation and train the enemy agent using Evolution Strategy optimization.

The trained model will be saved to `enemy_rl_gpu.npz`.

_**Assistant**_

I can see from your terminal output that your CUDA environment is properly set up, but the GPU training modules aren't being found. Let me provide you with the correct terminal commands to get GPU training working.

## Issue Analysis

Your system shows:
- ✅ CUDA 12.9 is installed and working
- ✅ RTX 5070 GPU detected with 12GB VRAM
- ❌ Missing CUDA extension module (`gpu_environment`)
- ❌ Missing required dependencies (`tqdm`, `rich`)

## Fix Dependencies First

````bash
# Install missing stable-baselines3 dependencies
pip install stable-baselines3[extra]

# Install additional requirements
pip install tqdm rich pycuda
````

## Build the CUDA Extension

````bash
# Navigate to your project directory (you're already there)
cd C:\Users\aiand\Documents\programming\ai-platform-trainerv1

# Build the CUDA extension
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

# Alternative if setup.py doesn't exist - create and build manually
python -c "
import subprocess
import os
subprocess.run(['nvcc', '--version'], check=True)
print('CUDA compiler working')
"
````

## Create Missing GPU Environment Module

Since the `gpu_environment` module is missing, create it:

````python
"""
GPU Environment module for CUDA-accelerated training
"""
import numpy as np
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Flag to indicate if GPU environment is available
HAS_GPU_ENV = False

try:
    # Try to import CUDA physics kernels
    from . import physics_cuda
    HAS_GPU_ENV = True
    logger.info("CUDA GPU environment loaded successfully")
except ImportError as e:
    logger.warning(f"CUDA GPU environment not available: {e}")
    HAS_GPU_ENV = False

def make_env():
    """Create a GPU-accelerated environment"""
    if HAS_GPU_ENV:
        from ..ai.models.gpu_rl_environment import GPURLEnvironment
        return GPURLEnvironment(batch_size=1)
    else:
        # Fallback to CPU environment
        from ..ai.models.game_environment import GameEnvironment
        return GameEnvironment()

class GPUPhysicsEngine:
    """GPU-accelerated physics engine"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.has_cuda = HAS_GPU_ENV
        
    def update_positions(self, entities_x, entities_y, velocities_x, velocities_y, 
                        screen_width=1200, screen_height=650):
        """Update entity positions using GPU acceleration"""
        if self.has_cuda:
            # Use CUDA kernels
            return physics_cuda.update_positions(
                entities_x, entities_y, velocities_x, velocities_y,
                screen_width, screen_height
            )
        else:
            # CPU fallback
            entities_x += velocities_x
            entities_y += velocities_y
            
            # Wrap around screen boundaries
            entities_x = np.where(entities_x < 0, entities_x + screen_width, entities_x)
            entities_x = np.where(entities_x >= screen_width, entities_x - screen_width, entities_x)
            entities_y = np.where(entities_y < 0, entities_y + screen_height, entities_y)
            entities_y = np.where(entities_y >= screen_height, entities_y - screen_height, entities_y)
            
            return entities_x, entities_y
````

## Training Commands (After Fixes)

Now you can run these commands:

### 1. Pure NumPy GPU Training (Works without CUDA)
````bash
python -m ai_platform_trainer.ai.models.train_enemy_rl_gpu
````

### 2. GPU Environment with Stable-Baselines3 (Fixed)
````bash
python ai_platform_trainer/cpp/train_gpu_fixed.py --num-envs 4 --timesteps 50000
````

### 3. Build and Test Pipeline (Fixed)
````bash
python build_and_test_gpu_pipeline.py
````

### 4. Training with Safe Wrapper
````bash
# First create the safe wrapper training script
python ai_platform_trainer/cpp/safe_env_wrapper.py
````

## Alternative: Use Working CPU Training

Since your GPU modules need compilation, you can continue training effectively with CPU:

````bash
# Train with CPU (this was working in your output)
python train_enemy_agent.py --episodes 1000 --output models/enemy_rl/gpu_model

# Test the trained model
python -c "
from ai_platform_trainer.gameplay.rl_enemy_controller import RLEnemyController
controller = RLEnemyController()
controller.load_model('ai_platform_trainer/models/enemy_rl_gpu.npz')
print('Model loaded successfully')
action = controller.get_action(0.5, 0.5, 100, 200)
print(f'Sample action: {action}')
"
````

## Verify GPU Setup
````bash
# Test GPU availability
python -c "
import torch
print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print(f'GPU: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}')
    print(f'Memory: {torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory / 1e9:.1f} GB')
"
````

The key issue is that your CUDA extension needs to be properly compiled. Once you install the dependencies and create the missing module, your GPU training should work properly.

_**User**_

(.venv) PS C:\Users\aiand\Documents\programming\ai-platform-trainerv1\ai_platform_trainer> pip install stable-baslines3[extra]
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement stable-baslines3[extra] (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for stable-baslines3[extra]

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the typo in the package name! It should be `stable-baselines3` (with a hyphen), not `stable-baslines3`. Let me give you the correct commands:

## Fix the Package Installation

````bash
# Correct package name (note the hyphen)
pip install stable-baselines3[extra]

# Install additional requirements
pip install tqdm rich gymnasium

# Optional: Install PyCUDA for GPU memory debugging (if you want CUDA support)
pip install pycuda
````

## Alternative: Install Core Dependencies Only

If the `[extra]` installation fails, install the core components:

````bash
# Core stable-baselines3
pip install stable-baselines3

# Individual extra dependencies
pip install tqdm rich tensorboard matplotlib

# Gymnasium (modern gym)
pip install gymnasium[classic_control]
````

## Test Your Safe Environment Wrapper

Your `safe_env_wrapper.py` looks excellent! Test it with:

````bash
# Test the safe wrapper
python ai_platform_trainer/cpp/safe_env_wrapper.py
````

## Create a Training Script Using Your Safe Wrapper

````python
"""
Training script using the safe environment wrapper to prevent crashes
"""
import logging
import numpy as np
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
from stable_baselines3.common.callbacks import CallbackList, CheckpointCallback, EvalCallback
from safe_env_wrapper import create_safe_env, make_safe_vec_env

        return GPURLEnvironment(batch_size=1)
    except ImportError:
        logger.warning("GPU environment not available, using CPU fallback")

        # Cleanup
        env.close()
        logger.info("Environment closed")

if __name__ == "__main__":

````

## Quick Environment Test

Before training, test if your environment works:

````bash
# Test environment creation
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('ai_platform_trainer/cpp')
from safe_env_wrapper import create_safe_env

def dummy_env():
    import gymnasium as gym
    return gym.make('CartPole-v1')

env = create_safe_env(dummy_env, max_steps=50, debug=True)
obs, info = env.reset()
print(f'Environment created! Observation shape: {obs.shape}')

for i in range(10):
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    obs, reward, done, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    print(f'Step {i}: reward={reward}, done={done}')
    if done:
        obs, info = env.reset()

print('✅ Safe environment test passed!')
"
````

## Run the Safe Training

````bash
# Create models directory
mkdir -p models/safe_training

# Run training with safe wrapper
python ai_platform_trainer/cpp/train_with_safe_wrapper.py
````

Your safe wrapper implementation is really well designed - it should prevent the heap corruption crashes you were experiencing by auto-resetting before the problematic step count is reached!
