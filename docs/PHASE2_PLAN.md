# Phase 2: C++/CUDA Reinforcement Learning Implementation

## Overview

Phase 2 will implement a high-performance reinforcement learning system using C++/CUDA for real-time learning during gameplay. This phase builds on the architecture established in Phase 1.

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Real-time RL Training**: Agent learns and improves during gameplay
2. **High Performance**: Sub-millisecond inference, <5ms training updates
3. **Visual Learning**: User observes AI skill progression in real-time
4. **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing Phase 1 architecture

### Secondary Goals
1. **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Easy/Medium/Hard pretrained agents
2. **Model Persistence**: Save/load trained models
3. **Training Metrics**: Live performance visualization
4. **Cross-platform Support**: Windows/Linux compatibility

## Technical Implementation

### C++/CUDA Core

#### Deep Q-Network (DQN) Algorithm
```cpp
class DQNAgent {
public:
    // Core interface
    int selectAction(const float* state, int stateSize, float epsilon = 0.1);
    void recordExperience(const Experience& exp);
    void trainStep();
    void loadModel(const std::string& path);
    void saveModel(const std::string& path);
    
private:
    NeuralNetwork network_;
    ReplayBuffer buffer_;
    CudaMemoryManager memory_;
};
```

#### Neural Network Architecture
- **Input Layer**: Game state vector (8-16 dimensions)
- **Hidden Layers**: 2-3 fully connected layers (128-256 neurons each)
- **Output Layer**: Q-values for each action (4-8 actions)
- **Activation**: ReLU for hidden layers, Linear for output

#### CUDA Acceleration
```cpp
// Neural network forward pass kernel
__global__ void forward_pass_kernel(
    const float* input, 
    const float* weights, 
    float* output, 
    int batch_size, 
    int input_size, 
    int output_size
);

// Gradient computation kernel
__global__ void compute_gradients_kernel(
    const float* predictions,
    const float* targets,
    float* gradients,
    int batch_size
);
```

### Python Integration

#### PyBind11 Bindings
```cpp
PYBIND11_MODULE(rl_core, m) {
    py::class_<DQNAgent>(m, "DQNAgent")
        .def(py::init<int, int, float>())
        .def("select_action", &DQNAgent::selectAction)
        .def("record_experience", &DQNAgent::recordExperience)
        .def("train_step", &DQNAgent::trainStep)
        .def("load_model", &DQNAgent::loadModel)
        .def("save_model", &DQNAgent::saveModel);
}
```

#### Python Agent Wrapper
```python
class RLAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, config: RLConfig):
        self.core = rl_core.DQNAgent(
            config.state_size,
            config.action_size,
            config.learning_rate
        )
        self.training_enabled = config.live_learning
    
    def select_action(self, observation: Dict[str, Any]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
        state = self._preprocess_observation(observation)
        action_idx = self.core.select_action(state)
        return self._action_to_movement(action_idx)
    
    def record_outcome(self, reward: float, new_state: Dict[str, Any], done: bool):
        if self.training_enabled:
            experience = self._create_experience(reward, new_state, done)
            self.core.record_experience(experience)
            if self._should_train():
                self.core.train_step()
```
